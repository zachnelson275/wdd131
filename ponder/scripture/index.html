        <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
        <p>
            And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our
            Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your
            foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
            yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his
            mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to
            drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the
            rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
            whereon if men build they cannot fall.

        <p>
            For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a
            stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his
            heart?

        <h2>2 Nephi 32:9</h2>
        <p>
            But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not faint;
            that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in the first
            place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that he
            will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be
            for the welfare of thy soul.
